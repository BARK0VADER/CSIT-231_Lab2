# Instructions

- Name your program lab2.c
- Ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 15
- If the user does not enter a number between 1 and 15, prompt the user to re-enter until they have
complied.
- For example, if I enter 16, your output should be something like:
- That is not a number between 1-15, please try again
- Then prompt the user if they would like to use recursion or not. You can prompt them with a simple Y
or N. Be aware the input is case sensitive, so please use capital Y and N.
- If recursion is desired, call a recursive function to calculate the factorial of N (N!). Where N is
the number entered by the user.
- If recursion is not desired, call a function that does not utilize recursion to calculate the factorial
of N (N!). Where N is the number entered by the user.

#extra 3 points if you can make it so the user can enter any capitalization or not of Y and N
-n, y
-N, Y
-n -> N
if you google the function, state where the source was found or else point deduction
